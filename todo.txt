Done:
Try with negative scan line points
Adjusting the weight of the scan line vs scan point residuals
Fix first frame to ground truth
Try map init from ground truth


Todo:
Implement the Jacobian
Implement Gauss-Newton/Levenberg-Marquardt
Search for c++ library for sparse matrix invertation (suite sparse), Cholesky decomposition

Add smoothing term for the SDF

More complicated scenarios


Handle points being projected outside the map properly:
Affected is the interpolation and anything that uses it, e.g. the derivatives
Currently the default value is 0
