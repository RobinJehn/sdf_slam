We want to minimise the distance between the projected points and the closest surface:
Problem: 
Setting the distance to 0 everywhere minimise the objective function

Maximise the sum of the distance values:
Problem: 
No continuity, goes to infinity everywhere where there is no point that uses it in the interpolation.
Lets say a point is at a grid node, Changing the value of that node doesn't change anything, it will be
x more for the map sum and x more for the distance, they cancel each other out
Map with just 1 point at (0,0) and we want to minimise M(0, 0) - m_00 = m_00 - m_00 = 0
Thus it has to be M(0, 0) - \lambda m_00 = (1 - \lambda)m_00, which is positive 1 > \lambda > 0
Relies on a decent initial, otherwise if changing the transformations doesn't bring points closer together,
there is no incentive to change the transformation

In other words, a map is optimal if the 


We somehow need a penalty for setting everything to zero when that cannot be the case, otherwise 
stacking all scans on top of each other gives the global minimum

We somehow need to incorporate the information, that space a laser went through should be empty


We want the gradient to be 1 everywhere
