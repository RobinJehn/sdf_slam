## SDF SLAM

When building this project you get several executables. They are all defined in the src/targets folder. generate_scan allows you to define a scene in config/generate_scans.yml to generate scans. sdf_slam lets you run the batch optimization on the dataset. The parameters can be set in config/sdf.yml. sdf_slam_incremental uses the same file for settings.
